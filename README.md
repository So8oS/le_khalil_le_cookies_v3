# Le Khalil Le Cookies: A Sweet Blast from the Past!

### 🚀 Intro, Anyone?
So, let me take you on a trip down memory lane. Back in the day, when I was still figuring out what the heck web dev was all about, my buddy Khalil Selyan was whipping up some wicked cookies at uni. Being the good friend that I am, I started working on this cool project for his cookie biz as a birthday gift. But let's be real, my early web dev days were like trying to bake without a recipe - I had no clue! So, the project was left gathering virtual dust.

Fast forward, and here we are! After putting some serious coding hours and love into it, I decided to give ol' “Le Khalil Le Cookies” the makeover it deserved.

### 🍪 The Cookies That Were
Khalil, man, he was the Cookie King! But time flies and his cookie empire isn't around anymore (yeah, bummer!). But hey, this project is like a sweet tribute to those good times.

### 🎨 Pixel Art Magic
Wait, did I mention that this app is wrapped in pure pixel art goodness? That's right! The design is a love letter to the pixel art, giving the app a nostalgic and fun vibe. It's like taking a bite out of a pixel cookie!

### ✨ What's In It?
So, let’s spill the beans (or should I say, cookies?). This baby’s almost done and you can check out the demo below. The prices are a throwback to the days before the Turkish Lira decided to go skydiving without a parachute.

- **Role-based auth?** Check.
- **Notifications?** Oh yeah.
- **Email confirmation?** You bet.
- **CRUD?** Like a boss.
- **Payment system?** Nah, back then we were all about that cash-on-delivery life at uni.

### The Techy Ingredients
Alright, my fellow code-crunchers, here’s what’s under the hood:

- **Next.js:** The backbone!
- **Tailwind CSS:** Making it all pretty.
- **Next Auth:** Keeping those logins legit.
- **Prisma:** My database sidekick.
- **Jotai:** State management baby.
- **React Toastify:** NOTIFICATIONSS!
- **React Hook Form:** Handling those forms like a pro.
- **React Email and Resend:** Making emails shine.
- Resend: Getting those emails out there.
- **Axios & SWR:** The tag team for fetching and API calls.
- **Bcrypt:** Keeping passwords on lockdown.

### 🌍  Why “Le Khalil Le Cookies”?
Khalil’s French skills are on point (mine, not so much). So in his honor and with a dash of humor, "Le Khalil Le Cookies" was born. It’s got that je ne sais quoi, don’t ya think?

And that's a wrap! I hope this project description gives "Le Khalil Le Cookies" the spotlight it deserves. May the cookies be with you!
